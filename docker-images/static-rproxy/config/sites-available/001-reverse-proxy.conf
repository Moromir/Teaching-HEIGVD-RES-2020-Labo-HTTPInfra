    # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
    # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
    # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName       
    # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to    
    # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this  
    # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.   
    # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
